	<h1>Bread made out of fairies </h1>
	<h2> Fairies made out of bread?</h2>
	<img src="Picture fairybread.png" alt="Poor poor bread fairy">
	<p>A classic Aussie snack for everyone!</p> 
	<p>Grab a piece of white bread, putting a very generous amount of heart killing butter and dump all the sprinkles on top. </p>
	<p>But what if we told you that fairy bread is actual bread made out of fairies!!!!</p>

<p>Haven’t you ever wondered where did all the fairies go. Our ancestors clearly saw them and they would never lie about their existence. </p> 
	<p>Well, they are all in your stomachs!!!</p>
	<p>Yeah, you heard ME. That feeling of butterflies in your stomach, well buddy those aren’t butterflies.</p>
	<p>All this time we have been eating those poor fairies and us Aussies being proud that this is our national snack being ignorant to what is truly happening.</p>
	<p>If all the fairies slowly disappearing then that means no more tooth fairies. How am I going to make my yearly income now!!! :0 </p>
	<p>So how does that make you feel knowing that you ate innocent people and made me lose my main source of finances.</p>
	<p>WHAT'S THAT? YOU FEEL BUTTERFLIES IN YOUR STOMACH NO THAT MUST BE ALL THE FAIRIES YOU’VE BEEN STUFFING YOUR MOUTH WITH!!!!!</p>

   <h1>Is it truly black or white?</h1> 
	<h2>Our exclusive interview with a magpie</h2>
	
	<img src="Picture 1.png" alt="Mugshot.">

    <p>Mug shot of the assaulter Menace the Denis</p>
	<p>We are covering the recent attack of a 9-year-old kid who was on his way home from school when all of the sudden he ambushed and beaten up by a gang of guys in white and black. </p>
	<p> They had blood shot eyes and stole all the kids’ belongings which was mostly the left-over lunch and marbles. The attack was unprovoked, all though authorities believe the kid may have looked at the gang in the wrong way. </p>
	<p>We were lucky enough to interview one of the gang, without our eyes being peaked out.  We spoke with the angry ball of feathers named Menace the Denis. </p>
	<p>Menace saw the little child as threat who came close to his property and had the rights to defend his home.</p>
	<p>We don’t blame him; I wouldn’t want kids near me either. </p>
	<p> Do you feel bad for beating up the kid we asked Denis? </p>
	<p> “AAARRRAAAAAAAAAHDGRRRRRJHGDKDGJG,” Denise replied. </p>
	<p>Touching words from a small feathered man. </p>
	<p>We came to the conclusion that Denis has trust issues and would lash out onto others to make himself feel better. Instead of confronting his issues and improve his communication, giving other people a chance. </p>
	 <p>So don’t be like a magpie guys, be better. </p>
